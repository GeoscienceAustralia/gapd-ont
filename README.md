# GAPD-O
An OWL ontology for all of GA's public data and metadata.

This ontology contains classes for most of the things that Geoscience Australia (GA) publishes in standardised ways, such as datasets in catalogues, vocabularies and web services. The classes in the ontology are mostly just subclasses of things found in a few well-known ontologies, such as [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) & [PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) with restrictions requiring certain metadata or relationships for them. This is so that GA and others can use this ontology to assess whether things published by GA are conformant with business requirements.
